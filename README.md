A game of patience. Using just two switches, a preprogrammed combination has been set for this counting IC. I challenge anyone to break the combination within 30 minutes and repeat it! 

Here is an ideal project if you are looking for something different in electron.ics. Many times I have wished I had an electronic brain teaser to try out on a witty friend or some small present to take to a sickie in hospital. Well here it is. Most of the games available on the market are too expensive or complex while others can be unravelled in a few minutes. With this game I think I have provided an ideal challenge. I like things which look easy but prove to be difficult. The secret combination (actually it should be called permutation) is locked into the game's CD 4017 IC via the gating diodes D3 D4D5and D6so that when any of the outputs go high, the switch Sw2must be in a position so that it:earths the signal and prevents it resetting the IC via  either diode D1 or D2(which feeds the reset pin 15). The object of the game is to light the red LED. With only two switches this looks at first to be an easy matter. Why, you may think, "I'll just have to push the switches randomly a few times and eventually I must strike the right combination." Well, chances are you won't, and secondly, you will not be able to repeat your effort again if you did happen to strike it after hours of trial. I would prefer to give you no clues at all on solving the combination however you will need to test the unit and thereby I lose my strategy. Without divulging too much I'll release two small clues. 1. Connecting the battery resets the IC. 2. The first switch (called the "clocking" switch) must be pushed nine times in total and  the second switch must be pushed twice. May I suggest you try random selections for 30 minutes to satisfy yourself that even with two major facts known, the combination is'still securely locked into the puzzle. After tiring of this, settle down and compile a table showing ail the possible combinations. Using this table will remove repetitive operations and you will most probably light the LED

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
Fig. 1 gives you no idea of the
operation of the circuit. I have
drawn it this way for two reasons.
Firstly, it makes the circuit very
simple (which it is) and secondly,
if someone asks you to see the
circuit to try and work out the
combination, he will be completely lost.
Connecting the battery will reset
the counter so that output pin 3
will have a high voltage on it.
Pressing the "clock" switch Sw1
will make pin 3 go low and pin 2
high. The high will pass through
D4 and into the 2k2 load R2 if
switch Sw2is in the up position.
If Sw2is pressed at any time pin
.2 is in a high state, the voltage
will pass through D2 and reset the
counter back to pin 3. There are
four such hidden reset paths
which have to be correctly manipulated for the signal to make 9
jumps and finally light up the
red LED. This may look simple
but believe me, if someone handed you the finished project and
asked you to decipher the
combination you would be at a
loss completely. I have another
project at a later date in which
the timing is absolutely critical
and yet another which has high
cycling on each switch, so an outsider doesn't know which variables are important and it is left
for him to show his ability. 
The main reason we draw the
IC as a vacant block (apart
from simplifying the schematic)
is due to the manufacturer rarely
releasing the circuitry. Of those
schematics which have been
released the circuitry is so
complex that it would fill up
an entire page of this magazine.
The internal workings of an IC
is of little importance to us.
We are mainly concerned with
the function of each pin and
the overall capability of the
little 14 pin wonder. We can
let you into a little more detail,
however, and reproduce all the
IC pins to show how the 10
outputs are turned on and off
one at a time, each time the
input pin is "clocked". Clocking
means applying a pulse to the
input pin 14. 
The output pins turn on and off
sequentially according to this pin
order: 3-2-4-10-1-5-6-9-11. This
can be quite confusing as it is
not in order of the pin numbering
on the IC! This unfortunate
sequence has come about in the
designing process and it sometimes makes printed circuit construction very difficult. For this
project I have used some of the
printed circuit as a platform for
the switches. Utilizing the copper
as a base makes the switch rigid
and integral with the board and
saves about $1. By using the PC
board upside down the IC and 
the parts can be mounted on top
of the solder-lands quite easily.
There is no need to drill any holes
and this is an additional saving.
The third and most important
reason for using an undrilled
board is the ease of removing
the parts once the project is no
longer required. I hope this will
never be the case!
Should you wish to "borrow"
the IC at a latter date for another
project all you need do is sit the
board upright, hold the ends of
the IC with your fingers and
run the soldering iron down a
row of pins. This will make the
IC come partly off the board
and by running the iron down
the other pins the IC will come
away cleanly. What a contrast
to removing an IC from a normal
PC board. Usually it's an almost
impossible task without a solder
sucker or desoldering iron and
plenty of patience.

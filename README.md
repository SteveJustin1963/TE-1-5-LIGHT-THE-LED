A game of patience. Using just two switches, a preprogrammed combination has been set for this counting IC. I challenge anyone to break the combination within 30 minutes and repeat it! 

Here is an ideal project if you are looking for something different in electron.ics. Many times I have wished I had an electronic brain teaser to try out on a witty friend or some small present to take to a sickie in hospital. Well here it is. Most of the games available on the market are too expensive or complex while others can be unravelled in a few minutes. With this game I think I have provided an ideal challenge. I like things which look easy but prove to be difficult. The secret combination (actually it should be called permutation) is locked into the game's CD 4017 IC via the gating diodes D3 D4D5and D6so that when any of the outputs go high, the switch Sw2must be in a position so that it:earths the signal and prevents it resetting the IC via  either diode D1 or D2(which feeds the reset pin 15). The object of the game is to light the red LED. With only two switches this looks at first to be an easy matter. Why, you may think, "I'll just have to push the switches randomly a few times and eventually I must strike the right combination." Well, chances are you won't, and secondly, you will not be able to repeat your effort again if you did happen to strike it after hours of trial. I would prefer to give you no clues at all on solving the combination however you will need to test the unit and thereby I lose my strategy. Without divulging too much I'll release two small clues. 1. Connecting the battery resets the IC. 2. The first switch (called the "clocking" switch) must be pushed nine times in total and  the second switch must be pushed twice. May I suggest you try random selections for 30 minutes to satisfy yourself that even with two major facts known, the combination is'still securely locked into the puzzle. After tiring of this, settle down and compile a table showing ail the possible combinations. Using this table will remove repetitive operations and you will most probably light the LED
